// This custom processor require all the javascript files from the above locations. While this should be enough for most parts, 
// other processors can be mentioned to specify the load order manually
// If you want to change the load order from the other engines, extensions and root_app mentioned above, you can add an app.js in those locations. Doing so will then OVERRIDE this app.js and would take files from there.
